# Synthetic-Division-Template
I created the Excel Workbook about six years ago while taking a Pre-Calculus class.  I got tired of writing synthetic division to test all the rational roots of a polynomial, so I came up with this workbook.  It does synthetic division for 4-, 5-, and 6-term polynomials.  Eventually, I'll get around to creating a GUI in Java based on this workbook.
